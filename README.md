## Technologies
All "Design to code" here is built with simple HTML/CSS/JS file because it is only one page. For the CSS framework/utility, I use two version of every design: Bootstrap and Tailwind. You can see each code in the several folder in this repo. To improve user experience, I use anime.js to add interaction in every page.
